            <p className="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">
            Jane Amelda Hind was born in North London, England in 1964, to Maureen and Charles Feeney. Her family has originated from Cleggan, a quaint fishing village on the west coast of Ireland which holds much appeal for writers and artists for its beauty and tragic history. 
            Jane is a qualified psychotherapist and over the years she has worked with victims of physical and/or sexual violence, offering clinical support to ex-offenders of violence and sexual abuse - in a bid to reduce and manage any risk of them further offending. 
            Whilst her encounters with perpetrators of violence have surged in recent years, so too has her interest to understand our human relationship with the extreme, in all its forms.
